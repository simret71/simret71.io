        In this website you will learn all of the basics and necessities on baking as well as some fun facts and a little bit of the history of baking.
        <br>
    Lets start with the basics. The first thing you want to do is always prep by cleaning your station, washing your utensils and washing your hands.

    When baking you want to make sure that you always preheat your oven just to ensure that your treat is evenly cooked and also it saves you time. The basic utensils you need in most recipies are as follows:<br>
    ~Whisk/Electric mixer (in most cases it doen't matter.)<br>~Measuring cups/Spoons.<br> 
    ~One or two mixing bowls<br>
    ~And a baking sheet/pan<br> 
    (keep in mind that the types of utensils vary depending on the recipe)<br><br><br>
    <b>The differences between baking and cooking</b><br>
    In case you didn't know baking and cooking are two decently different things. Granted they both involve making food the main difference is that baking is usually when you make desserts of baked sweets. Whereas cooking is something like when you're making dinner,lunch, or even breakfast. It usually means you're making a savoury or a spicy dish.<br><br>
   <b>The history of baking</b><br>
    Did you know that the world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in 2014 and it was apparently from 6500 years ago. The Ancient Egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they had previously been using to brew beer.

    Did you know that the world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in 2014 and it was apparently from 6500 years ago. The Ancient Egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they had previously been using to brew beer. Also eggs keep things glued together. The egg yolks contain something called lipids, a special kind of fat that adds colour and flavour to cookies. Meanwhile, egg whites contain albumin, a protein that interlocks when it's heated, giving your dish structure.
<br><br><b>Education</b>
     Although there are no formal education requirements to become a baker, some candidates attend a technical or culinary school. The programs generally last from 1 to 2 years and cover nutrition, food safety, and basic math. To enter these programs, candidates may be required to have a high school diploma or equivalent. The average Baker salary in Canada is $29,250 per year or $15 per hour. Entry level positions start at $23,888 per year while most experienced workers make up to $49,725 per year.
